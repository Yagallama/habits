# Habits
I've collected a pretty large dataset of my habits over the years, from when I first discovered Notion and started my habit tracker in one place. Since then, more than two years have passed and I decided to actually take a look at the data based on what I've learned at University. So, this is just an exploratory look at my habits to actually visualise my habit progress over the years and to see if there are any interesting patterns.

This is an informal investigation, so I did what I thought was fun, and hope you enjoy taking a look as well. If there's anything else interesting that you pick up, or if you'd like to give me any feedback (always trying to learn!) drop me a note on dc.dianachiang@gmail.com!
