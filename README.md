# Habits 2021-23

A project I finished last year that I recently cleaned up and decided to share. I have collected more data than I have included in the analysis here, both in terms of data tracked (no, you don't get to see *all* of my tracking data) as well as number of records (I have now also taken a look at 2024!) but that feels too personal to share. 

When I did this analysis, I was just trying to practice what I learned at university and was curious to actually visualise the habit data I've tracked since discovering Notion and digitizing my planner. So, I decided to take an exploratory look at the data I've collected and visualise my habit progress over the years to see if there are any interesting patterns.

This is an informal investigation, so I did what I thought was fun, and hope you enjoy taking a look as well. If there's anything else interesting that you pick up, or if you'd like to give me any feedback (always trying to learn!) drop me a note on dc.dianachiang@gmail.com!
